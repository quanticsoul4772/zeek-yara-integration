# Network Security Monitoring Basics

Understanding network security monitoring is fundamental to protecting digital infrastructure. This guide explains core concepts, methodologies, and tools that form the foundation of modern cybersecurity defense.

## What is Network Security Monitoring?

Network Security Monitoring (NSM) is the practice of collecting, analyzing, and responding to network traffic data to identify and mitigate security threats. It combines multiple detection methods to provide comprehensive visibility into network activity and potential threats.

### Core Principles

**Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls provide redundant protection
**Continuous Monitoring**: 24/7 observation of network activity for anomalies
**Rapid Response**: Quick detection and containment of security incidents
**Evidence Collection**: Gathering forensic data for investigation and compliance

## The NSM Process

### 1. Data Collection

**Network Traffic Capture**:
- Full packet capture for detailed analysis
- Metadata extraction for scalable monitoring
- Flow analysis for pattern recognition
- Protocol-specific monitoring (DNS, HTTP, etc.)

**File Extraction**:
- Automatic extraction of files from network streams
- Preservation of file metadata and context
- Safe handling and analysis of potentially malicious content

**Log Aggregation**:
- Centralized collection of security logs
- Normalization and enrichment of log data
- Real-time streaming and batch processing

### 2. Analysis and Detection

**Signature-Based Detection**:
- Pattern matching against known threat indicators
- High accuracy for known threats
- Fast processing and low false positive rates
- Requires regular signature updates

**Behavioral Analysis**:
- Statistical analysis of normal vs. abnormal behavior
- Machine learning and anomaly detection
- Effective against unknown threats (zero-days)
- Higher complexity and potential false positives

**Threat Intelligence Integration**:
- External threat feeds and indicators
- Contextual information about threats
- Attribution and campaign tracking
- Automated indicator updates

### 3. Response and Mitigation

**Alert Triage**:
- Prioritization based on severity and context
- Automated filtering and correlation
- Human analyst review and validation
- Escalation procedures for critical threats

**Incident Response**:
- Immediate containment actions
- Forensic investigation procedures
- Evidence preservation and documentation
- Recovery and lessons learned
