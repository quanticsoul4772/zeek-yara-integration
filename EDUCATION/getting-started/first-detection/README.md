# Your First Threat Detection

Welcome to your first hands-on cybersecurity experience! This tutorial will walk you through detecting the EICAR test file - a safe, industry-standard test for antivirus and security systems.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will:
- Understand how threat detection works in practice
- Successfully detect a test "malware" file using YARA
- See how network monitoring captures file transfers
- Experience the complete detection workflow

## Prerequisites

- Completed the [Installation Guide](../installation/)
- Basic command-line familiarity
- 15-20 minutes of time

## The EICAR Test File

The EICAR (European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research) test file is a safe, standard test for antivirus software. It's not actually malware, but security tools detect it as if it were malicious.

**EICAR String:**
```
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
```

## Step 1: Create the Test File

Let's create our test file:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/zeek_yara_integration

# Create a test directory
mkdir -p test-detection

# Create the EICAR test file
echo 'X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*' > test-detection/eicar.txt

# Verify the file was created
ls -la test-detection/
```

**Expected Output:**
```
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  3 user  staff   96 Jan 28 10:00 .
drwxr-xr-x 15 user  staff  480 Jan 28 10:00 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   68 Jan 28 10:00 eicar.txt
```

## Step 2: Run Your First Scan

Now let's scan the file using the integrated scanner:

```bash
# Run the scanner on our test file
python -m core.scanner --file test-detection/eicar.txt

# Alternative: Use the CLI tool (once implemented)
# ./TOOLS/cli/zyi scan test-detection/eicar.txt
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üîç Scanning file: test-detection/eicar.txt
üìä File size: 68 bytes
üîç YARA scan results:
  ‚úÖ DETECTED: EICAR-Test-File
  üìù Description: EICAR antivirus test file
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Severity: Test
  üïê Scan time: 0.001 seconds

üéâ Detection completed successfully!
```

## Step 3: Understanding the Results

Let's break down what just happened:

### Detection Details
- **File identified**: The EICAR test signature was recognized
- **Rule matched**: A YARA rule specifically designed to detect EICAR
- **Severity level**: Marked as "Test" since it's not real malware
- **Speed**: Detection happened in milliseconds

### Behind the Scenes
1. **File Reading**: The scanner read the file contents
2. **YARA Processing**: YARA rules were applied to the file
3. **Pattern Matching**: The EICAR string pattern was found
4. **Alert Generation**: A detection alert was created
5. **Result Display**: Results were formatted and shown

## Step 4: View Detection Logs

Your detection has been logged! Let's examine the logs:

```bash
# View the latest detection logs
tail -n 20 DATA/runtime/logs/scanner.log

# View alerts in JSON format
cat DATA/runtime/alerts/latest_alerts.json | python -m json.tool
```

**Sample Log Output:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-28T10:00:15.123Z",
  "event_type": "detection",
  "file_path": "test-detection/eicar.txt",
  "file_hash": "275a021bbfb6489e54d471899f7db9d1663fc695ec2fe2a2c4538aabf651fd0f",
  "yara_matches": [
    {
      "rule": "EICAR_Test_File",
      "description": "EICAR antivirus test file",
      "severity": "test",
      "tags": ["test", "eicar"]
    }
  ],
  "scan_duration_ms": 1.2
}
```

## Step 5: Simulate Network Detection

Now let's see how this would work in a network monitoring scenario:

```bash
# Create a simple HTTP server to simulate file transfer
cd test-detection
python -m http.server 8080 &
SERVER_PID=$!

# Give the server a moment to start
sleep 2

# Download the file (simulating network transfer)
wget http://localhost:8080/eicar.txt -O downloaded_eicar.txt

# Stop the HTTP server
kill $SERVER_PID

# Scan the downloaded file
python -m core.scanner --file downloaded_eicar.txt
```

This simulates:
1. **File transfer** over HTTP
2. **Network capture** (in a real scenario, Zeek would capture this)
3. **File extraction** from network traffic
4. **Automated scanning** of extracted files

## Step 6: Clean Up

Remove the test files:

```bash
# Remove test files
rm -rf test-detection/
rm downloaded_eicar.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "Command not found" error
**Solution**: Ensure you're in the project directory and have activated the virtual environment:
```bash
cd /path/to/zeek_yara_integration
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

**Problem**: No detection results
**Solution**: Verify the EICAR string was created correctly:
```bash
cat test-detection/eicar.txt
# Should output: X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
```

**Problem**: Permission denied errors
**Solution**: Check file permissions and ensure you have write access:
```bash
chmod 755 test-detection/
ls -la test-detection/
```

## Understanding the Technology

### What is YARA?
YARA is a pattern-matching engine designed to help malware researchers identify and classify malware samples. It uses rules written in a special syntax to describe malware families or patterns.

### How Network Monitoring Works
In a real SOC environment:
1. **Network traffic** flows through monitoring points
2. **Zeek** extracts files from network streams
3. **YARA** scans extracted files for threats
4. **Alerts** are generated for suspicious content
5. **Analysts** investigate and respond to threats

### The Detection Pipeline
```
