## Documentation Philosophy

### Educational First

All documentation serves educational purposes and should:

- **Support Learning**: Help users understand concepts, not just procedures
- **Build Knowledge**: Connect new information to existing knowledge
- **Encourage Exploration**: Provide pathways for deeper investigation
- **Be Inclusive**: Welcome users of all skill levels

### User-Centered Design

Documentation should be written from the user's perspective:

- **Address User Goals**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
- **Anticipate Questions**: What might confuse or block the user?
- **Provide Context**: Why is this information important?
- **Offer Multiple Paths**: Support different learning styles and preferences

### Quality and Accuracy

All documentation must be:

- **Accurate**: Technically correct and up-to-date
- **Complete**: Comprehensive without being overwhelming
- **Tested**: All instructions and examples verified to work
- **Maintained**: Regularly updated as the project evolves
