from core.scanner import BaseScanner

class TestBaseScanner:
    def test_initialization(self):
        """Test scanner initializes correctly."""
        scanner = BaseScanner()
        assert scanner.is_initialized
    
    def test_file_processing(self, sample_file):
        """Test file processing workflow."""
        scanner = BaseScanner()
        result = scanner.process_file(sample_file)
        assert result.success
        assert result.scan_time > 0
```

### Platform-Specific Testing

The project includes pytest markers for handling cross-platform compatibility testing. These markers allow tests to run only on specific operating systems or groups of systems.

#### Available Platform Markers

**Individual Platform Markers:**
- `@pytest.mark.linux` - Runs only on Linux systems
- `@pytest.mark.macos` - Runs only on macOS systems  
- `@pytest.mark.windows` - Runs only on Windows systems

**Group Platform Markers:**
- `@pytest.mark.unix` - Runs on Unix-like systems (Linux and macOS)
- `@pytest.mark.posix` - Runs on POSIX-compliant systems

#### Usage Examples

**Basic Platform-Specific Tests:**
```python
import pytest
import platform
import subprocess

@pytest.mark.linux
def test_linux_specific_behavior():
    """Test that runs only on Linux systems."""
    assert platform.system() == "Linux"
    
    # Test Linux-specific functionality
    result = subprocess.run(['which', 'apt-get'], capture_output=True)
    assert result.returncode == 0, "apt-get should be available on Linux"

@pytest.mark.macos
def test_macos_specific_behavior():
    """Test that runs only on macOS systems."""  
    assert platform.system() == "Darwin"
    
    # Test macOS-specific functionality
    result = subprocess.run(['which', 'brew'], capture_output=True)
    assert result.returncode == 0, "brew should be available on macOS"

@pytest.mark.windows
def test_windows_specific_behavior():
    """Test that runs only on Windows systems."""
    assert platform.system() == "Windows"
    
    # Test Windows-specific functionality
    import os
    assert os.name == 'nt'
```

**Unix-like Systems Testing:**
```python
@pytest.mark.unix
def test_unix_commands():
    """Test Unix commands available on both Linux and macOS."""
    assert platform.system() in ["Linux", "Darwin"]
    
    # Test commands common to Unix-like systems
    result = subprocess.run(['which', 'grep'], capture_output=True)
    assert result.returncode == 0
```

**Combining with Other Markers:**
```python
@pytest.mark.linux
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_linux_integration():
    """Integration test specific to Linux."""
    # Test Linux-specific integration behavior
    pass

@pytest.mark.unix  
@pytest.mark.performance
def test_unix_performance():
    """Performance test for Unix-like systems."""
    # Test performance on Unix systems
    pass
```

**Traditional skipif Approach (Alternative):**
```python
@pytest.mark.skipif(platform.system() != "Darwin", reason="macOS only")
def test_macos_grep_behavior():
    """Alternative approach using skipif."""
    # Test macOS-specific grep behavior
    result = subprocess.run(['grep', '--version'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    assert 'grep' in result.stdout.lower()
```

#### Running Platform-Specific Tests

**Run tests for specific platforms:**
```bash
# Run only Linux-specific tests
python -m pytest -m linux

# Run only macOS-specific tests  
python -m pytest -m macos

# Run only Windows-specific tests
python -m pytest -m windows

# Run Unix-like system tests
python -m pytest -m unix

# Run tests excluding specific platforms
python -m pytest -m "not windows"

# Combine platform markers with other markers
python -m pytest -m "linux and integration"
```

**CI/CD Integration:**
Platform markers work seamlessly with the existing CI matrix that runs tests on ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, and windows-latest. Tests will automatically be filtered based on the runner's operating system.

#### Best Practices

**When to Use Platform Markers:**
- Testing OS-specific command availability
- Handling different path separators or file systems
- Testing platform-specific integrations (package managers, etc.)
- Validating OS-dependent behavior

**Guidelines:**
- Use descriptive test names that indicate platform requirements
- Include platform assertions in test bodies for clarity
- Prefer group markers (unix, posix) over individual markers when appropriate
- Document platform-specific requirements in test docstrings
- Use skipif for complex conditional logic, markers for simple platform filtering

### Test Data

**Guidelines:**
- Use safe, non-malicious test files
- Create minimal reproducible examples
- Document test data sources
- Include diverse file types and scenarios

**EICAR test file:**
```bash
# Safe test malware signature
echo 'X5O!P%@AP[4\\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*' > test_eicar.txt
```
