## Backlog Management

### User Story Structure
```markdown
**As a** [type of user]
**I want** [goal/functionality]
**So that** [benefit/value]

**Educational Value**: [How this contributes to learning objectives]
**Difficulty Level**: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]
**Estimated Effort**: [1-8 story points]
**Prerequisites**: [Required knowledge/setup]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] [Specific, testable condition]
- [ ] [Documentation updated]
- [ ] [Tests written and passing]
- [ ] [Educational materials created/updated]
```

### Story Sizing and Estimation

#### Story Points Scale
- **1 Point**: Simple bug fix, documentation update (1-2 hours)
- **2 Points**: Small feature addition, refactoring (half day)
- **3 Points**: Medium feature, complex bug fix (1 day)
- **5 Points**: Large feature component (2-3 days)
- **8 Points**: Major feature or architectural change (1 week)

#### Difficulty Levels
- **Beginner**: Good first issues, clear requirements, mentoring available
- **Intermediate**: Requires some domain knowledge, moderate complexity
- **Advanced**: Complex technical challenges, architectural decisions

### Backlog Prioritization

#### Priority Levels
1. **Critical**: Security issues, major bugs, project blockers
2. **High**: Core functionality, roadmap milestones
3. **Medium**: Enhancements, performance improvements
4. **Low**: Nice-to-have features, future considerations

#### Educational Priority Matrix
- **High Learning Value + High Priority**: Ideal for intermediate contributors
- **High Learning Value + Low Priority**: Good for beginners
- **Low Learning Value + High Priority**: Best for experienced contributors
- **Low Learning Value + Low Priority**: Defer or eliminate
